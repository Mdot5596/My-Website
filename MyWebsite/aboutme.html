    <h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hi, I’m Morgan. I am a passionate game developer based in the UK with a First-Class Honours degree in Computer Science(Games Development) from the University of Plymouth.</p>

<p>I grew up in Greenwich, London, where my love for video games began with the Nintendo DS and Wii. Over time, that curiosity evolved from just playing games to wondering how they were made. I started exploring game design through online videos and developer breakdowns of my favourite titles.</p>

<p>This interest led me to study Game Development at Cirencester College, where I created a 2D fishing game and learned the fundamentals of digital design. I later transitioned to studying Computer Science in Bristol, achieving A*A*A grades and gaining real-world experience during a month-long internship in Prague, developing websites for IDF.</p>

<p>At university, I dove deeper into game development — working with Unity, C#, and C++, and developing several projects both independently and in teams. These experiences not only sharpened my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of game design principles and player experience.</p>

<p>Outside of formal education, I continue to grow by experimenting with engines like Unreal and Godot, constantly learning new tools and techniques to push my creativity and technical abilities further.</p>

<p>Feel free to explore my projects - I’m always working on something new.</p>
