    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Morgan. I was born in London and grew up in Greenwich. From a young age, I have had a passion for video games, starting with a Nintendo DS and a Wii in my early years. As I got older, I found myself playing more and more, becoming increasingly curious about how these games—so full of entertainment—were created.</p>

    <p>I began by watching online videos about development secrets in my favourite games and how levels were designed. This curiosity led me to pursue game development after finishing school. My journey started at Cirencester College, where I studied game development and created a 2D fishing game using [insert software here, I forgot].</p>

    <p>After a year, the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and I transferred to a college in Bristol, where I studied Computer Science for two years. I completed my studies with A*A*A grades and gained a month of work experience in Prague, working on website development for IDF.</p>

    <p>Following college, I continued my pursuit of game development by enrolling in a Computer Science course at the University of Plymouth. Here, I gained hands-on experience in game development, learning to use Unity, programming in C# and C++, and understanding the fundamental thinking behind creating a game. I have worked on several projects, both individually and in teams, which you can explore on the Projects page.</p>

    <p>In my free time, I am expanding my skill set by learning additional game engines such as Godot and Unreal Engine, ensuring that my expertise extends beyond Unity. I am always eager to learn new technologies and develop new skills.</p>
